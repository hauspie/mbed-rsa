	- Changed the way rflpc_printf outputs chars (uses a function pointer)
	- Added rflpc_uart0_byte_available() function
	- Fixed the rflpc-config script so that lib and sample compiles even if gcc is not configured for cortex-m3 by default
	- renamed rflpc_printf to printf
0.6a:
	- Fixed rflpc-config script by adding forgotten -mthumb
0.6:
