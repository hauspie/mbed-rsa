/** @addtogroup systick System tick timer
 * @ingroup drivers
 * This driver allows the use of the system tick timer.

   This timer is intended to generate a precise 10ms timer, however it can be
   used to count different times. But, the tick count is only on 24bits so,
   at 96Mhz, the maximum wait time is 2^24 ticks (around 170ms)

   Its counter is decremented at each clock tick, and when the counter reaches
   0, an interrupt can be generated. The time between interrupts thus depends
   on the counter value and the clock speed.

   This driver uses the cpu clock as the reference clock for the timer.
